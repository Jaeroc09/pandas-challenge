Analysis of school and standardized test data using Pandas and Jupyter notebook

by Jason Estrada

With standardized test (math and reading) data in the `Resources` folder, analysis was performed for all schools in a district, and aggregated into groups:
* Per Capita Spending
* School Size
* School Type

Made use of the Pandas library, and output the results using Jupyter notebook.
